I also, created a factory for view controllers, promoting code separation and reusability.\n\n• Networking and Error Handling: I gained insight into handling network operations, including making HTTP requests using URLSession. Including handling network errors with URLSession and JSON decoding using Codable objects.\n\n• Other things I learned about: UIKit, Protocols, Typealiases, Enumerations, UICollectionViewCompositionalLayout, UICollectionViewDiffableDataSource and Structs."

This entailed setting up data source and delegate methods to ensure smooth table view operations.  \n* Network Operations and JSON Parsing: My role involved understanding and implementing network requests asynchronously using the powerful URLSession. I, also, played a key role in parsing JSON data retrieved from the network in Codable structures using diverse decoding strategies. \n\n* Other things I learned about: Protocols, UIRefreshControl Integration, Data Sorting, Navigation Flow, Custom UITableViewCell, UIImageView Extension, Date Formatting, Table View Management and Structs.

This function utilises storyboards for view controller instantiation and navigation.  \n* Data Management: I actively participated in managing notes using the NoteManager class. This class handles note storage, retrieval, deletion, and replacement, making it a crucial component of the app's data management.  \n* User Defaults Usage and Note Editing View: I learned to use UserDefaults for storing and retrieving notes, enabling persistent data storage and I worked on the NoteDetailsViewController, which allows users to create and edit notes. This view controller includes text view placeholders, dynamic text view resizing, and efficient note saving and updating.  \n* Other things I learned about: Protocols, UIViewController Setup, UITableView Implementation, Custom UITableViewCel, Delegate Implementation, User Interface Enhancement and Structs.
